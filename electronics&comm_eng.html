                    <p>Mechanical Engineering Department is the driving force behind many of our technological and
                        industrial processes. The Department is rightly recognized as the mother of engineering.
                        Mechanical
                        engineers require a solid understanding of key concepts including mechanics, kinematics,
                        thermodynamics, energy, and manufacturing. The benefit of this fundamental role is that the
                        subject
                        provides a wide choice of career opportunities in industries as diverse as food,
                        pharmaceuticals,
                        energy, petrochemical industries, and environmental protection and conservation. It is one of
                        the
                        oldest and broadest engineering disciplines. The department has well-qualified faculty who
                        produce
                        numerous publications in International/National journals, highlighting the emphasis on research
                        and
                        development. The Department has a modern workshop equipped with the latest machinery in fitting
                        and
                        machine shops. <br><br>

                        Mechanical Engineering is concerned with all types of machinery in industries and all aspects of
                        their mechanism and functioning- the design, development, construction, production,
                        installation,
                        operation, and maintenance. Regular workshops training, industrial visits, specialized lectures,
                        and
                        seminars are conducted to familiarize students with the working of machine tools found in the
                        industry. They are also given project problems covering design, fabrication, testing,
                        manufacturing
                        aspects thus giving them opportunities to develop their capability to solve practical problems
                        through the use of computers. The Department is committed to well-being and all-round
                        development of
                        its students and is to prepare the manpower that is globally best.<br><br>

                        The department focuses on creative and innovative classroom teaching, teamwork, interpersonal
                        communication skills, group discussions, seminars, membership in professional societies, clubs,
                        and
                        research activities. The department uses modern methodologies like LCD projectors, interactive
                        lectures, guided case studies, industry interaction, literature surveys and project work for
                        better
                        understanding among students. EIT is one of the <span class="bold"> Colleges for Mechanical

                    <span class="bold">Scope and Future Prospects of Mechanical Engineering:</span>
                    <br><br>
                    Mechanical engineering, one of the oldest branches of Engineering, deals with the design,
                    manufacturing,
                    and maintenance of machines. With the advent of modern technology, the domain of this evergreen
                    branch
                    of engineering has extended and now its students are opting for learning robotics, nanotechnology,
                    etc.
                    Now, you may be wondering, whether students should still opt for mechanical engineering or not. The
                    lack
                    of job offers to graduates has de-motivated students to choose mechanical engineering as a stream.
                    But
                    don’t worry, Mechanical Engineer jobs in Mumbai are increasing day by day and are offering lucrative
                    opportunities to skilled mechanical engineer students.<br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Scope of Mechanical Engineering</span>
                    <br><br>
                    The scope of mechanical engineering includes the design and manufacturing of industrial machinery,
                    the
                    best state-of-the-art motor vehicles, and aircraft. Moreover, the maintenance and testing of such
                    machinery are key responsibilities of mechanical engineers. The mechanical engineering field engulfs
                    the
                    concepts of thermodynamics, mechanics, fluids, and structural analysis. Not only machinery and
                    vehicles,
                    mechanical engineers learn to develop engines, complex machinery systems, and power equipment. They
                    learn the application of material science, physics, and applied mathematics.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="bold">New Trends & Future Scope</span>

                    With the advancement of new technology, the scope of mechanical engineering has expanded and new
                    domain
                    includes robotics, geomechanics, nanotechnology, and computer-aided design. Many engineers opt for
                    robotics and mechatronics, which are the combinations of mechanical engineering stream with other
                    streams.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="bold">Robotics :</span> Robotics is a combined stream of mechanical engineering,
                    computer
                    science, and electrical engineering. It aims at designing and developing robotic systems. Mechanical
                    engineering aims to develop computer systems that control robotic systems. The demand for Robotics
                    as a
                    stream is expected to grow in the coming decade with the start of the AI revolution.<br>
                    <span class="bold">Mechatronics :</span> Mechatronics is a combination of mechanical engineering, IT
                    (Information Technology), and electrical engineering. The scope of mechatronics ranges from
                    designing
                    complex engineering systems to processing automation.<br><br>
                    With the widening of the scope of mechanical engineering, mechanical engineers are not limited to
                    the
                    manufacturing industry anymore but also they get the opportunity in other industries with good
                    remuneration packages. But of course, these facilities are for skilled and proficient engineers.

                    <span class="bold">The Present Market Scenario </span> <br>
                    Though the average yearly income of mechanical engineers is below Rs.3.5 lakhs, knowledge of
                    robotics
                    and electrical systems will help you to get a better pay package. Though now the pay offer is lower
                    than
                    computer science, it will rise again. According to the global consultancy firm Deloitte, India is
                    expected to create more new opportunities for mechanical engineers in India in the nearby future.

                    <br><br>
                    Conclusion

                    There will be a gap between the demand and supply of mechanical engineers in near future. The demand
                    for
                    skilled mechanical engineers will exceed the supply. Though several new trends and technologies have
                    been introduced, most of the colleges follow the old curriculum. Therefore, there is a lack of
                    skilled
                    engineers. The lack of skills and proper knowledge in mechanical engineers are throwing challenges
                    to
                    newly graduated engineers to get a good job. Now it is the responsibility of all mechanical
                    engineering
                    colleges to bridge the skill gap. The mechanical engineers should be well-versed with new
                    technological
                    knowledge, coding, and communication skills. <br><br>

                    <span class="bold">Future Aspects:</span><br><br>

                    Major industries that employ mechanical engineers include Defence Services, DRDO, ISRO, Automobiles,

                    sector.
                    <br><br>
                    In the government sector like civil services, engineering services, etc. Mechanical engineers can
                    provide their knowledge to various government-run projects in the role of technical experts and
                    consultants. They can also work in private engineering companies that provide technical consultancy
