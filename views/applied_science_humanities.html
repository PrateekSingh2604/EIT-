                <br><br>
                Mechanical engineering, one of the oldest branches of Engineering, deals with the design,
                manufacturing,
                and maintenance of machines. With the advent of modern technology, the domain of this evergreen
                branch
                of engineering has extended and now its students are opting for learning robotics, nanotechnology,
                etc.
                Now, you may be wondering, whether students should still opt for mechanical engineering or not. The
                lack
                of job offers to graduates has de-motivated students to choose mechanical engineering as a stream.
                But
                don’t worry, Mechanical Engineer jobs in Mumbai are increasing day by day and are offering lucrative
                opportunities to skilled mechanical engineer students.<br><br>

                the
                best state-of-the-art motor vehicles, and aircraft. Moreover, the maintenance and testing of such
                machinery are key responsibilities of mechanical engineers. The mechanical engineering field engulfs
                the
                concepts of thermodynamics, mechanics, fluids, and structural analysis. Not only machinery and
                vehicles,
                mechanical engineers learn to develop engines, complex machinery systems, and power equipment. They
                learn the application of material science, physics, and applied mathematics.

                <span class="bold">New Trends & Future Scope</span>

                With the advancement of new technology, the scope of mechanical engineering has expanded and new
                domain
                includes robotics, geomechanics, nanotechnology, and computer-aided design. Many engineers opt for
                robotics and mechatronics, which are the combinations of mechanical engineering stream with other
                streams.
                <br><br>
                <span class="bold">Robotics :</span> Robotics is a combined stream of mechanical engineering,
                computer
                science, and electrical engineering. It aims at designing and developing robotic systems. Mechanical
                engineering aims to develop computer systems that control robotic systems. The demand for Robotics
                as a
                stream is expected to grow in the coming decade with the start of the AI revolution.<br>
                <span class="bold">Mechatronics :</span> Mechatronics is a combination of mechanical engineering, IT
                (Information Technology), and electrical engineering. The scope of mechatronics ranges from
                designing
                complex engineering systems to processing automation.<br><br>
                With the widening of the scope of mechanical engineering, mechanical engineers are not limited to
                the
                manufacturing industry anymore but also they get the opportunity in other industries with good
                remuneration packages. But of course, these facilities are for skilled and proficient engineers.

                <span class="bold">The Present Market Scenario </span> <br>
                Though the average yearly income of mechanical engineers is below Rs.3.5 lakhs, knowledge of
                robotics
                and electrical systems will help you to get a better pay package. Though now the pay offer is lower
                than
                computer science, it will rise again. According to the global consultancy firm Deloitte, India is
                expected to create more new opportunities for mechanical engineers in India in the nearby future.

                <span class="bold">Top Recruiting industries For Skilled Mechanical engineers</span>
                There will be always a huge demand for skilled mechanical engineers in the following top industries:
                <ol>
                    <li>Automobile Industry</li>
                    <li>Aerospace Industry</li>
                    <li>Robotics And Mechatronics</li>
                    <li>Power And Metal Plants</li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
                Conclusion

                There will be a gap between the demand and supply of mechanical engineers in near future. The demand
                for
                skilled mechanical engineers will exceed the supply. Though several new trends and technologies have
                been introduced, most of the colleges follow the old curriculum. Therefore, there is a lack of
                skilled
                engineers. The lack of skills and proper knowledge in mechanical engineers are throwing challenges
                to
                newly graduated engineers to get a good job. Now it is the responsibility of all mechanical
                engineering
                colleges to bridge the skill gap. The mechanical engineers should be well-versed with new
                technological
                knowledge, coding, and communication skills. <br><br>

                <span class="bold">Future Aspects:</span><br><br>

                Major industries that employ mechanical engineers include Defence Services, DRDO, ISRO, Automobiles,
                space research, aeronautical, railways, energy and utilities, air conditioning, bio-mechanical
                industry.
                Other major employers include giant manufacturing plants, air conditioning and refrigeration
                industry,
                turbine manufacturing plants, oil and gas exploration and refining industries, and the agricultural

                <br><br>
                In the government sector like civil services, engineering services, etc. Mechanical engineers can
                provide their knowledge to various government-run projects in the role of technical experts and
                consultants. They can also work in private engineering companies that provide technical consultancy
                to
                both government and Corporate firms</p>
