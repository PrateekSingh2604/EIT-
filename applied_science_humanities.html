                <p> I feel ecstatic to introduce you to Department of Humanities and Applied Sciences, which is the foundation of Engineering. Department of Applied Sciences strives for increasing the knowledge, enhancing the critical thinking, ability to change information into knowledge and power of analyzing the things technically of each and every individual of ever changing society through students. We always intend to impart knowledge through a closed knit family of highly competent faculty. Department of Applied Sciences plays a vital role in an engineering college catering to the teaching of basic Sciences and Humanities courses for engineering students of all branches. The aim of applied sciences in Engineering study is to lay a strong foundation of basic principles of various disciplines such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Communication Skills in the mind of the students, so that they proceed to rest of their years of study with up to date knowledge and training of basic engineering skills. Our Laboratories have been very well established not only to cover complete syllabus but to motivate students to learn beyond the syllabus which definitely develops complete knowledge of the subject (both the practical and theoretical depth of knowledge) and develop skill sets of students to become promising engineers in future. Thus the Department of Applied Sciences and Humanities acts as a fertilizer to develop a good base for student’s studies, personality and skills. This department is the backbone of all disciplines in Engineering and Technology.</p>

                    The language lab caters to the syllabus of JC Bose University of Science & Technology. The main objective of the Language Lab is to develop students’ communication skills in English. Communication lab is helpful to enrich the discourse competence, to prepare the learner to be able to produce contextualize written text and speech.  Many students are hesitant to come on the dais. The lab is equipped with SANAKO software to train them to overcome hesitation and use language effectively so as to face interviews and participate in group discussions, public speaking etc. It enables them to learn better pronunciation through stress on word accent, intonation, and rhythm. It is also helpful to cultivate the habit of reading passages from the computer monitor and initiate them into greater use of the computer in resume preparation, report writing, format-making etc. thus providing them with the required facility to face computer-based competitive exams. <br><br>
