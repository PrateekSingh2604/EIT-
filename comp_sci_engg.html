                    It is a general observation that students at the entry level of undergraduate programs and
                    especially belonging to the rural India are shy in using computers and often feel hesitant in its
                    operation. On the contrary, the technical skills of an engineer clearly put forth the need to have a
                    sound knowledge of application of computer and its different software to solve problems of vivid
                    nature. To provide practical exposure and on-hand working environment to such students, the college
                    has over 650 computer workstations made available in several air conditioned laboratories of the
                    college building. They are fully networked with branded (IBM, HP, Compaq) i3, i5 & i7 systems and
                    servers. High internet speed of 100 Mbps, broadband internet connectivity has been provided in main
                    computer center with at least one faculty and technical staff to guide them.<br><br>
